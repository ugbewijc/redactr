##### Scenario:
Redact app is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste some content into a form field and then specify the words that must be scrambled (using another field). Note that the user can specify more than one word (separated by space) to be scrambled.

Redact app also allows users to specify what to use in replacing the words so that the app can do the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, question marks, dashes, underscores, or even other words, and display stats like:
 - how many words were scanned,
 - how many matched the words to be scrambled,
 - how many characters were scrambled in total,
 - how long it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task. 

After clicking a “Redact Now” button, the app scans through the original text and replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ****) or the inputed replacing words
